      <h1>Case Study - Modern PARADISEC</h1>

<h3 id="modern-paradisec">Modern Paradisec <a class="direct-link" href="#modern-paradisec">#</a></h3>
<p>Status: ARDC-funded demonstrator</p>
<p><a href="https://www.paradisec.org.au/">PARADISEC</a> (the Pacific And Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures) has operated a data curation service for endangered languages for 18 years. Currently consisting of 500,000 files in 28,624 items and 574 collections there is over 90TB of data under management. The repository, whilst still functional and fit for purpose, is showing signs of its age. So using the <em>Arkiso Platform</em> the Modern PARADISEC project is modernising the catalog whilst also enabling a path for smaller regional repositories to exist and to be able to easily move their content across collections and institutions.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://115.146.80.165/">Modern PARADISEC demonstrator</a> developed with previous funding from the [ARDC] demonstrates the use of RO-Crate to describe the collections and items and storage of those items within an OCFL system. In this demonstrator there is an elastic search service and a webserver but the key feature is that the demonstrator keeps working with only the filesystem and a webserver.</p>
<p>Tools adapted in the PARADISEC system<br>
PARADISEC serves a number of functions. It is a curated set of citable primary data (using doi). It continues to convert analog material (audio, video, text, images) into standard digital files. It provides the motivation and means for researchers to build, describe, and cite their research materials which would otherwise be inaccessible or lost. It publishes metadata using OAI-PMH for the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC), that is also harvested by RDA and Trove. It connects researchers and the communities they have worked in. As most of the materials in PARADISEC record traditional cultural expression (TCE) they have high significance to the source communities who can now access it via the web. Because the collection is structured using standards, we are able to deliver it in various forms, appropriate to the recipient. One of these is on raspberry pi transmitters for local phone access. We have done this with the same microservicces we developed for the online platform.</p>
<p>PARADISEC’s access and storage have been developed over 18 years, and some parts are in need of renewal. It is also the model for other archives and we are currently advising a consortium in Japan and working actively with the colleagues at theUniversity of French Polynesia to build an archive in Papeete.</p>
<p>TODO: Consider moving these to tools?<br>
Elan - media transcription - XML output, microservice developed to play media and transcripts. Allows citation of points in media</p>
<p>Fieldworks Language Explorer - Text and dictionary construction<br>
LaMeta</p>
<p>CSV - metadata entry sheet</p>
<p>Microservices already developed<br>
Elan file viewer: provides researchers with a dashboard to see how much of  a file has been transcribed<br>
Media players - linking transcripts to media (granular citation of media for research purposes)<br>
Community connection<br>
Most of the files were are targeting in Arkisto are of interest to the general public, and often also to a specific community.</p>
