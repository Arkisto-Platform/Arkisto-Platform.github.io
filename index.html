Arkisto </p>
   <p>
   Humans being endlessly creative, they produce research materials in a range of formats, with a range of software.
While this may work for the lifetime of a research project, there needs to be a way of capturing research output and allowing it to be found and accessed in future, with appropriate licensing arrangements.
</p>
<p>Arkisto builds pathways from a range of existing data formats and captures the knowledge encoded in the software and data, making it explicit and keeping metadata together with the data.
Arkisto is also the locus for training in using better methods so that data is more easily curated at the end of a research project.</p>

<p>Arkisto is a scaleable, standards based platform for sustainable data. It is built
      on top of <a href="https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/">Research Object Crate (RO-Crate)</a> and the <a href="https://ocfl.io/">Oxford Common File System
      Layout (OCFL)</a> and enables research services to support diverse research
      domains. Current examples range from linguistics to bioinformatics as well as
      discipline-agnostic repositories such as institutional data repositories.
   </p>

   <p class="text-left text-4xl font-bold">Say goodbye to messy data migration</p>

   <p>The basis of Arkisto is that the long-term preservability of
   well-described data is <em>always</em> the first consideration - that data on an
   Arkisto deployment is alway available on disc (or object storage) with a
   complete description <em>independently</em> of any services, such as websites or APIs.

   Once the data is safe and well described, Arkisto has a flexible model for how
   data can be accessed using a variety of services:

   <ul class="list-disc">
      <li> Human and machine oriented access-controlled data portals that make data
         available by searching and browsing and by API. There are currently two
         established portal projects and a number of active developments.
      </li>

      <li> Direct access by trusted services which can read and write data from the
      storage layer.</li>
      <li>  Validation and preservation services at the data storage layer.</li>
   </ul>

<br/>
<p> Arkisto has provided a curated dataset from existing research repositories, for example, the 90 terabytes of data held by Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (PARADISEC), now completely described in Arkisto (thanks to a small grant from the ARDC) and ready for development of microservices to complete the transition from a monolithic catalog. </p>
<p>A major driver for Arkisto are collections of research material that are no longer looked after and some current examples are:</p>   <ul class="list-disc">
<li>The eScholarship Research Centre, University of Melbourne. The ESRC has nearly 1,000 projects, mostly stored in MS Access databases, but with html versions generated from those databases. As the ESRC has been closed in 2020, the pressing issue is what to do to preserve all of this valuable scholarship.</li>
<li>Omeka repositories</li>
<li>FMPro catalogs, e.g. at the <a href="https://arts.unimelb.edu.au/grimwade-centre-for-cultural-materials-conservation">Grimwade Centre for Cultural Materials Conservation</a> which catalogs hundreds of Indigenous artworks. Data stored in this kind of proprietary format needs to be exported into meaningful output and Arkisto addresses this need.</li>
<li>AIATSIS</li></ul>

<p class="text-4xl tracking-wide my-8 text-left font-bold">
Why Arkisto?</p>

<p>It is increasingly apparent that research projects need to provide for their endings before they begin. A project run out of the <a href="https://scip.unimelb.edu.au/">Social and Cultural Informatics Platform</a> at the University of Melbourne is the New Life for Digital Research (NeLDiR) which is using Arkisto's methods to preserve research outputs. NeLDiR is inspired by <a href="https://www.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/our-work/archiving-sustainability/">existing work</a> done at Kings College (London) on rescuing expired research projects,
or the work of the Canadian <a href="https://projectendings.github.io/resources/">Project Endings</a>, both of which are leading the way, and we need to be engaging with this critical issue in Australia. </p>
